This is very, very, very early development stage.

Most probably, this code will not work. You have been warned!

But...

If you download the code:
1. Edit conf.yaml
2. Edit content/my_first_post.markdown
3. run python bucket3.py --init
4. run python bucket3.py --generate
5. copy the contents of html/ to a directory accessible by your web server (according to the baseURL value you entered in conf.yaml)

Dependencies:
You will need to have installed the following python modules
- markdown
- PyYAML
- sqlite3 (make sure your python is compiled/installed with sqlite enabled)
- django (bucket3 uses the django template engine))
